    - parse author names
    - handle @preamble
    - handle integer IDENT
    - write out the encountered errors
    - include locations in errors

field@entry:line: error message


DUPS
* look for duplicate entries that have different keys?

REMOVETAG
* remove all tags of the given type


LIST
    biblint list author
* list all the values for the given field, along with the pubs that have
  that value
  sort the values by "similar" values
* for authors "have that value" means "has that author"

* list all the authors and the pubs with them

SORT
* by key, year, first author, last author, journal (any tag)
    biblint sort -by [key|...]

GENKEYS
* generate keys from records using various patterns
biblint genkeys "{author1}:{year}"

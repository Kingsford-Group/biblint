BUGS:

DONE:
    - recognize quoted ints
    - parse author names
    - handle @preamble

FMT
- convert {{INT}} -> INT
- remove total {} field unless needed
* sort by key

LINT
* check for unecessary {} around entire string
* Check for undefined symbols
* Check for missing commas
* Check for duplicate keys
* Check for duplicate symbol definitions
* Check for malformed author names
* Check for missing required fields
* look for duplicate entries that have different keys?

DUPS
* look for duplicate entries that have different keys?

REMOVETAG
* remove all tags of the given type

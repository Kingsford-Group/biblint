LINT

- Find authors that are misformatted
- Find " that are not in {}

/*
TODO:
    - write additional unit tests and have them acutally check the output
    - handle #
    - handle {"}'s in strings

BUGS:

DONE:
    - Find titles that are entirely enclosed in {}
    - Find all caps words that are not inside {} and strange caps words
        (i.e. any word that isn't Xxxx or xxxx)
    - remove empty fields
    - recognize quoted ints
    - parse author names
    - handle @preamble
    - handle integer IDENT
    - write out the encountered errors
    - include locations in errors

CLEAN

- add option to disable cleaning steps?

- merge adjacent {} nodes?
* add {} around " in fields
* Handle Word-Word-Word in IsStrangeCase
* Replace lone - in pages with --
* remove . from the end of titles
* back replace months
* Sorts entries by year
* Removes empty fields
* Removes non-blessed fields
* Removes {} around entire fields (trying to {} smaller sections}
* Converts {INT} -> INT
* Puts @preamble at the top
* Puts @string at the top (after @preamble)
* Remove all comments
* Normalize whitespace within fields
* Format all authors as von Last, First or von Last, Jr, First
* Use symbols whenever unambiguious
* Format the entries consistently, ordering fields consistently
* PAges that look like NUMBER - NUMBER -> NUMBER--NUMBER
* Pages A--B where A > B -> replace B with the expansion based on A
* lowercase words in Journal name

mRNA, DNA are great -> {mRNA,} {DNA} are great
{mRNA, DNA} are great

- when sorting, expand symbols

LINT
- Check for malformed author names
* Lone - instead of --- in title?
* "et al" appearing in author lists
* Non-ascii characters anyplace
* Check for "years" that are not INTs
* Pages A--B where A > B 
* Check for undefined symbols
* Check for duplicate symbol definitions
* Check for duplicate keys
* Check for missing required fields


Someday:
- Pages that only contain symbols ?
- Check for unmatched $
- Check for volumes, numbers that are not INTs
- check for two symbols defining same thing?


field@entry:line: error message


DUPS
* look for duplicate entries that have different keys?

LIST
    biblint list author
* list all the values for the given field, along with the pubs that have
  that value
  sort the values by "similar" values
* for authors "have that value" means "has that author"

* list all the authors and the pubs with them

REMOVETAG
* remove all tags of the given type

SORT
* by key, year, first author, last author, journal (any tag)
    biblint sort -by [key|...]

GENKEYS
* generate keys from records using various patterns
biblint genkeys "{author1}:{year}"
